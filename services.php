      <p>Our equipment is modular and is custom built to suit the needs of each facility.  In our experience, each facility has differences in their material properties and contaminants.  Even though our equipment is rugged and designed for heavy-duty contamination levels, the separation process is precise and needs to be optimized for each situation.  The requirements of each facility in terms of precision is also different: some facilities may have heavily contaminated material and require a 95% plus plastic separation rate, another may require a 99% separation rate, others may be satisfied with 80% and so on.  Plastics dominate the contaminant loading in most situations, but other variables include textiles, carpets, clothing, wires, hose, glass, rocks and metals.  Given the breadth of contaminant variables and customer requirements, we do not manufacture and sell one-size-fits-all equipment because we believe it may not bring our customers the best value for their money.  Our goal is to provide our customers with the best advice and equipment to help them successfully meet their goals.  When our customers are successful, so are we!  The first step in the process is for us to understand completely the challenges and needs of each customer.</p>
