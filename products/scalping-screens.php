              <p>We recommend the use of our vibrating scalping screens when your material contains unpredictable particles and objects that would otherwise require manual removal from the material stream.</p>

          <p>Some compost facilities have been forced to accumulate large piles of contaminated screening overs.  Other times, the overs coming off the trommel or star deck, vary greatly in particle size and feed rate (read: kitchen sinks, carpets, stumps, 100lb rocks).  Either way, to get the most out of BCE's unique separation equipment, we offer surge bins and optional vibrating scalping screens to deal with the toughest situations, and ensure that you get cost effective and hassle-free separation performance.</p>
          <p>Primarily designed to feed the Compost Liberator in a stand-alone configuration (i.e. does not require a trommel to feed it), our surge bins can also be integrated with our other separation machines to ensure efficient and steady performance.</p>
          <p>Our surge bins are sized according to the separator they are feeding, and the size of the bucket/method you are using to load it.  Built Yukon-tough, you can expect these surge bins to cope with a wide range of material types and moisture contents without having to worry about bridging and blockages.  Like our other machines these bins are available electrically driven, in stationary or skid mount configurations.</p>
