          <p>This separator is intended for use in situations where too much visible plastic is getting into the undersize/fine compost, usually intended for sale.  If you are getting complaints from your customers about fruit and vegetable stickers, drinking straws and tiny plastic pieces being in their compost, this machine will literally sort it out.  This unique and innovative piece of vibratory equipment easily removes barely visible plastic pieces from compost fines.  The fine contaminant separator will go where no vacuum system can dream of, requires very little maintenance, and consumes an incredibly low amount of power.  This machine can be configured to a variety of screened particle sizes and feed rates.  Available as electric drive, with diesel or hydraulic options.</p>
