          <p>Our trommel screens are designed to be integrated with the Compost Liberator system.  For some facilities it makes the most sense to separate the contaminants from the finished compost prior to size separation.  If you are tired of having plastics plug up your screens, and the inevitable fight to clean them out, then its time to rethink your screening set up. The Compost Liberator can feed almost any type of trommel or star screen, but that may not be the most efficient or cost effective method for some facilities.  That is why we offer our own purpose-built trommel screens that are fully integrated with the Compost Liberator for optimum performance and cost efficiency.</p>
          <p>Connected in series, the surge bin, Compost Liberator, and trommel screen offer users a streamlined, energy efficient contaminant separation and screening outfit that is robust and simple to use.  Our trommels are only available as no-frills stationary or skid-mount units with electric drives, which makes these units a much more economical alternative to own and operate.</p>
