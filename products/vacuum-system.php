      <p>Unlike other vacuum-based separation systems on the market, our unique design uses a vacuum blower to draw separated plastics directly into a purpose built roll-off bin.  Because the contaminants go directly into the bin, the vacuum blower cannot be damaged by plastics wrapping or jamming the impeller.  This also prevents the blower from blocking up with plastics and other objects, and reduces the power consumption requirement.  The result is a system that can handle larger pieces of plastic with entrained organic matter without becoming blocked up, as is the case with competitive vacuum systems.  Another benefit of this system is that all the plastics are captured in a sealed bin eliminating issues with stray plastics being blown about.  Due to the size of the bin, running time is greatly extended compared to systems that require frequent sock changes, for example.  The bin can be emptied by any standard hook or cable lift truck.</p>
      <p>The vacuum nozzle (or nozzles, depending on customer requirements) can be mounted on any conveyor without the need for permanent modification.  The vacuum system can also be augmented by an air knife to improve separation performance.  This system is mounted at the discharge end of any conveyor.</p>
      <p>The roll-off bin and vacuum system is our most economical plastic separation system and is suited to facilities that experience light contamination with film plastics.  Available as electric or diesel drive.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Economical solution for light contamination situations.</li>
        <li>Simple to use.</li>
        <li>Blower can't be damaged or blocked up.</li>
        <li>Plastics cleanly deposited in convenient, high capacity roll-off bin.</li>
        <li>Can be adapted to a wide range of existing equipment, situations and feed rates.</li>
      </ul>
