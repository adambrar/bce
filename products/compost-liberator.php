              <h3>Compost Liberator In Action</h3>
              <p>The Compost Liberator will help you slash your landfill and labour costs, whilst producing valuable product streams.  If you have a contaminant problem at your compost facility, you simply can't afford to be without a Compost Liberator.</p>

          <p>We chose this name for the simple reason that it does what it says on the label: it will liberate your compost from a wide variety of contaminants reliably, all day, everyday.  In doing so it will use a fraction of the energy of any other separation machine on the market today.  It doesn’t require ongoing adjustment even with changes in moisture content, and it won’t block up or jam.  It will provide you with guaranteed separation performance, day after day, in a range of sizes that meets the needs of many compost facilities.  The Compost Liberator can be configured to remove everything from coffee makers to coffee pods to those pesky little produce stickers, and everything in between.  (It will also remove tarps, carpets, right down to barely visible fragments of film and hard plastic).  It can also be configured to remove glass, rocks, and metals, in a separate stream.</p>

              <h3 class="card-text text-center">New Compost Technology</h3>
              <p class="ml-4 mr-4">The Compost Liberator contains brand new patented and patent pending technology that has been developed over years of painstaking research and development in a real-life compost facility.  </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>It uses a three-stage process, each of which employs multiple separation techniques.  Even though it contains proprietary technologies, it is now available to the industry competitively priced, complete with guaranteed performance.  We are able to offer these units in stationary and skid-mounted configurations.</p>
          <p>Powered by electricity, the Compost Liberator has an ultra-low energy requirement, and requires very little daily maintenance.  The wearing surfaces will provide years of service, and are easily and inexpensively changed if required.  Once set up, the Liberator does not need further adjustment during normal operation.  Simply turn it on, go to work, and expect steady, reliable, and precise contaminant separation in a wide range of moisture contents (up to 70%).  We use top quality drive and electrical components from big-name manufacturers that are designed for extended service life and low energy consumption even under severe-duty conditions.  Should there be any issues, components are easily replaced and readily available around the world.</p>
          <p>The Liberator system is primarily intended for processing heavily contaminated screening overs.  However, it can also process the fines fraction with some simple adjustments.  Another unique feature of this technology is that it can be used as the primary screening tool, removing contaminants first, then discharging the cleaned organics fraction into the trommel screen for normal size separation.</p>
