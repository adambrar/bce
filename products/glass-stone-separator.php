      <p>This innovative, patent pending machine effectively separates glass, stone, and other hard objects from compost.  In keeping with BCE's other innovations, the glass and stone separator is simple to use, requires very little maintenance, and has an ultra-low power requirement.</p>
      <p>Depending on the composting process and material type, rolling object conveyors, air classifiers, and float-sink tanks may not be effective or application-appropriate separators of stone and glass.  BCE's glass and stone separator exploits the differences in material hardness to effect precise separation.  This means that it can effectively separate tiny glass shards and small stones, as well as larger rocks, glass and concrete from compost, even if the material is wet or dry, or contains larger pieces of wood.</p>
      <p>This machine is especially useful to operators who recycle and perhaps regrind their screening overs, and want to avoid reintroducing rock and glass to the front end of their composting process.  It can also be used to upgrade compost to class A, by removing the sharp fragments of glass.</p>
      <p>The glass and stone separator can also be configured to remove metals and light plastics (where there is a low plastic contamination level).</p>
      <p>Available as electric drive, with a hydraulic option, in a stationary or skid-mount format.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Separates 95%+ of glass, stone and metals from compost.</li>
        <li>Efficiently removes small glass pieces and tiny stones, as well as larger pieces.</li>
        <li>Low maintenance, simple to use.</li>
        <li>Ultra-low energy requirement.</li>
        <li>Can be configured for light plastic separation.</li>
      </ul>
